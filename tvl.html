    <p style="text-align: center;"> TVL stands for Technical-Vocational-Livelihood. It is an academic strand or track within the Senior High School system in the Philippines. The TVL strand is designed to provide students with both academic knowledge and practical skills in various technical and vocational fields. This strand prepares students for employment opportunities right after graduation by offering specialized subjects related to specific trades, crafts, or industries. TVL may include specializations such as information technology, automotive technology, culinary arts, cosmetology, and more. Students who choose the TVL strand often have an interest in pursuing careers that require hands-on skills and technical expertise. The goal is to equip students with the skills needed for employment in specific industries or to provide a foundation for further technical and vocational education.</p>
