    <p style="text-align: center;">The STEM strand, which stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, is an academic program or specialization track in the education system. It is designed to focus on these core disciplines to provide students with a strong foundation in scientific and technical fields. The STEM strand aims to equip students with the skills and knowledge needed for careers in fields such as engineering, computer science, biology, physics, and other related areas. This educational track often emphasizes hands-on learning, problem-solving, and critical thinking, preparing students for further education in STEM-related fields or entry into the workforce with a solid foundation in science and technology.</p>
