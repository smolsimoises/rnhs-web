    <p style="text-align: center;">HUMSS stands for Humanities and Social Sciences. It is another academic strand or track within the education system, offering a different focus compared to STEM. The HUMSS strand is designed to provide students with a broad understanding of human society, culture, and individual behavior. It typically includes subjects such as history, literature, philosophy, sociology, psychology, and other social sciences. The HUMSS strand aims to develop critical thinking, analytical skills, and a deep appreciation for the humanities. Students who choose HUMSS often have an interest in pursuing careers in fields like communication, journalism, law, education, and social sciences. The strand not only prepares students for higher education but also equips them with a well-rounded education applicable to various professional paths in the humanities and social sciences.</p>
